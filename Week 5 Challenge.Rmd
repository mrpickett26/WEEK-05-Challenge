#Compare these estimates to the actual population mean runtimeMinutes for each decade and to the calculated SE in the population mean for samples of size 100 based on the population standard deviation for each decade.


#Between this generation of randomly sampled 100 data points and the population, there was the largest difference between means for the 60s. Though the 20s showed the highest standard error and standard deviation, it is a product of random sampling for this particular iteration that the 60s showed the largest difference in mean. For a greater number of iterations, I predict that the 20s will show the greatest difference in mean. The standard error for the sample was overall higher than for the population as was sd, however, much as I said above I believe that this variability is due to sampling and will become more uniform as I increase the repitions, or iterations of sampling.


#Generate a sampling distribution of mean runtimeMinutes for each decade by [a] drawing 1000 samples of 100 movies from each decade and, for each sample, [b] calculating the mean runtimeMinutes and the standard deviation in runtimeMinutes for each decade. Use either the do(reps) * formulation from {mosaic}, the rerun() function from {purrr}, or the rep_sample_n() workflow from {infer} to generate your these sampling distributions (see Module 12).

#looking at means, standard error and standard dev of results3 (population) and results51 (sample) the standard error of the mean for the sample is greater than the standard error of the population the means and sds are relatively comparable, but this would vary between iterations

# the CI values have a greater range for the 50 samples without reps and the mean and standard dev was higher for the 50 samples without reps and this could vary with iterations. The sampling with reps had a mean and sd closer to the population mean and sd, the sample with 199 reps was  normally distributed whereas the one with just 50 was more uniformly distributed.
